# User Interaction Recorder - Test Case Generator

## AI-Generated Project

This project was created entirely using AI tools (ChatGPT, Trae AI, and Perplexity.ai) without writing any manual code. It demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development and prompt engineering to create functional software solutions.

The browser extension automatically captures user interactions on web pages and generates structured test cases, streamlining the QA process.

## What Is This Tool?

The User Interaction Recorder is a browser extension and server application that automatically captures user interactions on web pages and converts them into structured test cases. It's designed to solve common testing challenges faced by QA teams in software development companies.

## Common Testing Challenges Addressed

### Time Waste in Manual Test Case Creation
- **Problem**: QA engineers spend 30-40% of their time manually writing test cases based on user flows
- **Solution**: This tool automatically records all interactions and generates test cases in real-time

### Inconsistent Test Case Documentation
- **Problem**: Different testers document test steps in different formats and levels of detail
- **Solution**: Standardized, automatically generated test cases with consistent format and detail level

### Missed Edge Cases
- **Problem**: Manual test case creation often misses important edge cases and user paths
- **Solution**: Captures all interactions exactly as performed, ensuring complete coverage

### Difficulty Reproducing Issues
- **Problem**: Developers struggle to reproduce issues reported by testers
- **Solution**: Precise recording of actions with XPaths, element identifiers, and values

### Time-Consuming Test Maintenance
- **Problem**: Updating test cases when UI changes is labor-intensive
- **Solution**: Easily re-record flows when interfaces change
